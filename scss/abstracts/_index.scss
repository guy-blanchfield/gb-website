// index @forwards scss files in scss/abstracts

// although the abstracts aren't outputting any css
// they still need forwarding, so that other sass files
// can @use 'abstracts' rather than having to @use each file
// in abstracts explicitly
// i.e. you're probably going to have to @use colors, mixins, variables etc
// in every sass file, so @use 'abstracts' is easier

@forward 'colors';
@forward 'mixins';
@forward 'type';
@forward 'variables';
